# Remote-Code-Publisher
1.Developed an application Remote Code Publisher that converts given source code files as web pages with embedded child links. Each link refers to a code file that the displayed code file depends on. 2. Used C++ CLI shim so that WPF GUI could interact with back end (native C++). Developed a message-passing communication system, based on Sockets, using HTTP Protocol to establish communication. 3. Provides feasibility for the client to send files to Remote Publisher which would publish .html for corresponding source files sent by user and also for client to view those .html files generated
